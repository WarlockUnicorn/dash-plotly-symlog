# Welcome to the  dash-plotly-symlog page!

The purpose of this repository is to provide an example of a symlog-like plot using Dash. At the time of this example, February 2021, plotly doesn't have this capability as a native feature. For more information please see the symlog documentation for Matplotlib, Dash, and Plotly:

- [Matplotlib Symlog](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/scales/symlog_demo.html)
- [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/)
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/)
