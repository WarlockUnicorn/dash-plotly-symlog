# Welcome to the  dash-plotly-symlog page!

The purpose of this repository is to provide an example of a symlog-like plot using [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/). At the time of this example, February 2021, [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) doesn't have this capability as a native feature. There is a [feature request](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/issues/221).

For more information please see the symlog documentation for [Matplotlib Symlog](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/scales/symlog_demo.html), [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/), and Plotly](https://plotly.com/).
